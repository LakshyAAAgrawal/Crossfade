# Crossfade (Image Merging)
This is an Android app which uses only the default APIs.
It inputs 2 images and layers them pixel by pixel, and then saves it to a jpg file(100% compression, no quality loss) in a folder, "Crossfade". It also notifies the MediaScanner about new media content.
The app also inputs the ratio in which the 2 images should be crossfaded, layered.
